# At the bottom of your file, write a comment about two entities that you looked up.

# ○ Did the entity make sense in terms of the word associated with it?

# 1. NORP - Nationalities or religious or political groups
# Yes, its a country and people there have a nationality called british, 
# British is a NORP enitity

# 1. ORG - Companies, agencies, institutions, etc.
# Falklands is an island however it picked it up as 
# ref: https://www.falklands.gov.fk/our-history
# Falkland Islands Government
# Therefore Flaklands itself I think should be and island, aka GPE enitity
# but there was a war, so ORG applies, I think, based on actual 
# newspaper article, org is sufficient.
